# WP Kecil: Wordpress Wrapper for Kecil, the Lazy and Blurry Image Preloader

Read more about Kecil here: http://github.com/workflow/kecil

## Install
Follow [this guide](http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/step-by-step-guide-to-install-a-wordpress-plugin-for-beginners/) to install the plugin to Wordpress. Once activated, it will immediately act on all images of your blog.

## Image Uploads
Images fetched from the Kecil server are cached in the uploads directory (`wp-content/uploads/kecil/`).
If you edit the image data itself and don't see updates on the preview images, go to your **plugins page** and click on the link saying `Empty Out Cache`.
